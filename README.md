Project Overview
This project is a mobile healthcare application designed to help users easily find available medications in nearby pharmacies while ensuring safe medication use. It addresses the common problem of drug shortages and the difficulty patients face when searching for specific medications, often visiting multiple pharmacies without success. In addition to showing real-time drug availability and pharmacy locations sorted by distance, the app includes a drug–drug interaction checker to enhance patient safety and provides alternative medication suggestions when a drug is unavailable. The project will be presented through a clear explanation of the problem, target users, and value proposition, supported by feature demonstrations, user research findings, and a competitive analysis to highlight its market fit and practical impact.

Project Objectives
1- To develop a mobile application that enables users to locate nearby pharmacies with available medications in real time.
2- To reduce the time and effort spent searching for unavailable medications by providing accurate location-based search results.
3- To enhance patient safety by integrating a drug–drug interaction checker that alerts users to potential medication conflicts.
4- To provide reliable alternative medication suggestions when a prescribed drug is unavailable.
5- To support informed decision-making by offering clear and accessible drug information, including dosage, indications, and side effects.
6- To improve medication adherence through reminder features and personal medication profile management.
7- To build a trustworthy and user-friendly digital health solution that addresses real market needs related to medication accessibility and safety.
8- To create opportunities for collaboration with pharmacies through inventory updates and data integration, ensuring information accuracy

Project Scope
1- Development of a mobile healthcare application
2- Drug availability search by brand and generic name
3- Display nearby pharmacies sorted by distance
4- Map integration with pharmacy location and contact details
5- Drug–drug interaction checker
6- Alternative medication suggestions
7- Personal medication profile 
8- Drug information library (indications, dosage, side effects, warnings)
9- Basic pharmacy dashboard for updating drug availability
10- User research and competitive analysis
11- UX/UI design and concept validation

Final Deliverable
The final output of this project will be a comprehensive mobile healthcare application prototype that addresses medication accessibility and safety challenges. The deliverable will consist of a high-fidelity, interactive prototype that demonstrates the system’s core functionalities, including real-time medication availability search, location-based pharmacy mapping, drug–drug interaction analysis, and alternative medication recommendations.
In addition to the functional prototype, the project will include complete UX/UI design documentation, user journey maps, information architecture, and system workflow diagrams that illustrate the operational structure of the application. The final submission will also incorporate user research findings, survey and interview analysis, and a detailed competitive analysis to validate the problem statement, market need, and feasibility of the proposed solution.
Overall, the final output will present a validated, user-centered, and scalable digital health solution, supported by research, design rationale, and strategic positioning within the healthcare technology market.
