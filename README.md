##  Project Overview

This project is a mobile healthcare application designed to help users easily find available medications in nearby pharmacies while ensuring safe medication use. It addresses the common problem of drug shortages and the difficulty patients face when searching for specific medications, often visiting multiple pharmacies without success. In addition to showing real-time drug availability and pharmacy locations sorted by distance, the app includes a drug–drug interaction checker to enhance patient safety and provides alternative medication suggestions when a drug is unavailable. The project will be presented through a clear explanation of the problem, target users, and value proposition, supported by feature demonstrations, user research findings, and a competitive analysis to highlight its market fit and practical impact.
